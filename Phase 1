Great, you've created a new public class named `ToDoListManager`! Now, let's start adding the properties and methods to implement the basic features of your ToDoListManager API.

Here's a step-by-step guide on what you can code next:

1. **Add Imports:**
   If your `ToDoListManager` class uses other Java classes or data structures, you'll need to import them at the beginning of your class file. For example:
   
   ```java
   import java.util.ArrayList;
   import java.util.List;
   ```

2. **Define Class and Properties:**
   Define the class and the properties you'll need. In this case, you'll want to maintain a list of tasks. You can do this by adding a private field inside your class:
   
   ```java
   public class ToDoListManager {
       private List<Task> tasks;
       
       // Constructor and methods will be added here.
   }
   ```

3. **Constructor:**
   Create a constructor for your `ToDoListManager` class. The constructor initializes the `tasks` list. You can use an ArrayList to store the tasks:
   
   ```java
   public ToDoListManager() {
       tasks = new ArrayList<>();
   }
   ```

4. **Add Task Method:**
   Add a method to allow users to add a new task to the list. This method takes a `Task` object as a parameter and adds it to the `tasks` list:
   
   ```java
   public void addTask(Task task) {
       tasks.add(task);
   }
   ```

5. **Mark Task as Completed Method:**
   Implement a method that allows users to mark a task as completed. This method can take a task ID as a parameter and update the corresponding task's completion status:
   
   ```java
   public void markTaskAsCompleted(int taskId) {
       for (Task task : tasks) {
           if (task.getTaskId() == taskId) {
               task.setCompleted(true);
               break;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

6. **Get All Tasks Method:**
   Create a method that returns a list of all tasks. This method simply returns the `tasks` list:
   
   ```java
   public List<Task> getAllTasks() {
       return tasks;
   }
   ```

7. **Get Pending Tasks Method:**
   Implement a method that returns a list of pending (not completed) tasks:
   
   ```java
   public List<Task> getPendingTasks() {
       List<Task> pendingTasks = new ArrayList<>();
       for (Task task : tasks) {
           if (!task.isCompleted()) {
               pendingTasks.add(task);
           }
       }
       return pendingTasks;
   }
   ```

8. **Remove Task Method:**
   Add a method to remove a task from the list based on its ID:
   
   ```java
   public void removeTask(int taskId) {
       tasks.removeIf(task -> task.getTaskId() == taskId);
   }
   ```

Remember, this is a basic implementation. Depending on your requirements, you can enhance and extend these methods. Additionally, you'll need to define the `Task` class and write the main method (similar to the example I provided earlier) to demonstrate the usage of your `ToDoListManager` class.

Finally, don't forget to add comments, documentation, and possibly exception handling to ensure your code is clear and robust.
